- Performance optimization techniques
- Real configuration examples

### 2. [Architecture Diagrams](./kong-architecture-diagrams.md) 
**Visual learning with 12+ detailed diagrams:**
- High-level Kong architecture
- Request flow sequences with your actual setup
- Plugin execution order and effects
- Security layer comparisons (current vs recommended)
- Monitoring and observability patterns
- Development vs production setups

### 3. [Hands-On Tutorial](./kong-hands-on-tutorial.md)
**10 practical labs for hands-on learning:**
- Testing Kong endpoints and route matching
- Understanding plugin behavior with real examples
- Security testing and authentication layers
- Performance analysis and latency measurement
- Error handling and debugging techniques
- Best practices implementation

## üéØ Key Learning Outcomes

After working through these materials, you'll understand:

- **Kong Architecture**: How control plane, data plane, and components work together
- **Configuration Management**: Properly setting up services, routes, plugins
- **Security Implementation**: Authentication, authorization, and rate limiting
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching, load balancing, and monitoring
- **Production Readiness**: Best practices and common pitfalls to avoid
- **Troubleshooting**: Debug techniques and error resolution strategies

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Start with fundamentals**: Read the [Kong Learning Guide](./KONG_LEARNING_GUIDE.md)
2. **Visualize the concepts**: Study the [Architecture Diagrams](./kong-architecture-diagrams.md)  
3. **Practice hands-on**: Work through the [Hands-On Tutorial](./kong-hands-on-tutorial.md)

## üí° Real-World Examples

These materials include examples from an actual Kong AI Gateway setup:
- **OpenAI Integration**: Routing requests to OpenAI's chat completions API
- **Anthropic Integration**: Connecting to Claude models via Anthropic's API
- **Plugin Configuration**: AI proxy advanced, semantic caching, rate limiting
- **Security Analysis**: Current setup issues and recommended improvements

## üîí Security Focus

Special emphasis on security throughout:
- Authentication best practices (Kong vs upstream auth)
- API key management and secure credential storage
- Rate limiting strategies to prevent abuse
- Request/response filtering for data protection
- Monitoring and alerting for security events
